        <p>
          JSJ Investments is a Texas-based family office with a 20-year history of investing in promising businesses. We invest in small- to mid-cap companies that are on the precipice of major growth and need strategic investment to facilitate it. Our portfolio includes companies in North America, Europe, and across the globe.        </p>
        <p>
          We provide access to funds — whether in the form of seed money, bridge financing, or simply an injection of capital. The companies we invest in have strong action plans with clearly identified targets. They are led by strong management with expertise and a track record of successes.        </p>
        <p>
          Our portfolio includes public and imminently public companies. We invest in private placements, secondary offerings, and IPOs. We also have extensive experience with alternative funding structures.        </p>
